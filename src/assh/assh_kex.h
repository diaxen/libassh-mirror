/**
   @file
   @short SSH key exchange module interface and helpers

   @ifnopt hide_internal
   This headed file defines the interface to use for pluggable
   key exchange algorithm implementations.

   The key exchange process involve several functions calls performed
   in the following order:
   @list
     @item The @ref assh_kex_send_init and @ref assh_kex_got_init
       function are called by the transport layer code.
     @item The @ref assh_kex_init_t function of the pluggable algorithm
       module is called from @ref assh_kex_got_init.
     @item The @ref assh_kex_process_t function of the module is called
       multiple times so that the module key-exchange FSM code can execute.
       It may return events.
     @item The @ref assh_kex_new_keys function must be called once from
       the @ref assh_kex_process_t function when the shared secret is
       available.
     @item The @ref assh_kex_end function must be called once from the
       @ref assh_kex_process_t function when the key exchange is over.
       This calls the @ref assh_kex_cleanup_t function and a
       @ref SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS packet is sent.
   @end list

   The server host key must be verified during the key exchange by
   using the pluggable signature algorithm given in @ref
   assh_session_s::host_sign_algo.

   Some helper functions are provided to compute the exchange-hash and
   deals with the host key signature.
