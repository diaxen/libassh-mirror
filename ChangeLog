 - added the assh_algo_supported function, allow testing algorithm availability
   at runtime
 - report the new local window size on ASSH_EVENT_CHANNEL_DATA events
 - added the assh_transport_output_size function
 - added the asshh_key_load_base64 and asshh_key_output_base64 functions

 - do not allow calling assh_event_done multiple times any more
 - the assh_key_algo_enumerate_static function now takes a context as parameter
 - improved the cipher bench test program
 - the asshh_fd_event function now returns -1 on error
 - added support for openssl 3
 - added the CONFIG_ASSH_MAX_PACKET_LEN constant

version 1.0, 03-Jan-2021
